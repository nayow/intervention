      div Heavily inspired by the principles of Burning Man, we have created our own three Principles: 
      div
        span.font-semibold Sharing and caring :&nbsp;
        span at our festival, we embrace the spirit of respect and love, fostering a close-knit community where kindness, thoughtfulness and generosity flow freely among all participants.
      div
        span.font-semibold Creating and Cooperating :&nbsp;
        span in a symphony of collaborative synergies, we unite our creativity and skills, where the fusion of each individual brilliance contributes to the greater good.
      div
        span.font-semibold Exploring and restoring :&nbsp;
        span shedding the constraints of our everyday life, we encourage free expression and inner exploration, while nurturing a culture of mindfulness to ensure the well-being of both mind and body throughout our journey together.
